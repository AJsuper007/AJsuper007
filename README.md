<h2>My name is AJsuper007 (not my real name) and I love coding.</h2>
<p>I have been working no some projects such as microbit and my most popular one, V Web. Coding has taught me many things about life and about the WWW. Technology will help us in life as we advance it. I believe everyone can code so they can build their own websites, make their own games and even create apps. If you would like to visit V Web then click <a href="https://ajsuper007.github.io/V-Web/">here</a>.</p>
